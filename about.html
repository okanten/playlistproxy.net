        <p>I wanted to share music with strangers online (through IRC etc) without revealing my identity in the process. This service is intented to let you share playlists anonymously. Although this is a spotify playlists anonymization service, you can also use this to share 8 (or any number) of your favorite tracks from a specific artist without hogging up your library. The way you would go about that is by creating a temporary playlist on your end, adding tracks and duplicating it with this service. You can delete your playlist afterwards and your friend can still enjoy your recommendations for as long as they want.</p>
        <p>The playlists generated will either have user-defined names and descriptions or predefined ones. We do not copy names and descriptions by default.</p>
